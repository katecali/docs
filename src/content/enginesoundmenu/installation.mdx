# Installing the Resource

<Steps>
### Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Gravxd/enginesound-menu/releases/latest)


### Permissions

To give players access to the menu, you'll need to give them the following ace permission:
<br/>`command.enginesound`

Example to give all players regardless of roles, access to the menu:
<br/>`add_ace builtin.everyone command.enginesound allow`

If you want to give permissions a different way, such as linked to your framework, a script or something else - you can edit the permissions function inside of `server_config`
```lua showLineNumbers filename="server_config.lua"
HasPermission = function(src)
    -- your permission function here - you can integrate your framework for jobs/perms etc
    return IsPlayerAceAllowed(src, 'command.enginesound')
end
```

### Configuration & Adding Custom Sounds

You'll now need to edit `client_config` - here you can change the keybind, menu positioning and more!
<br/>We also have a feature called `StoreSoundsByModel` which will automatically save what engine sound you last used on a specific model (spawncode) and re-apply that sound when you re-enter that vehicle.

Additionally, you can add your own notification script here, by default we use ox_lib.

At the bottom, you will see the list of engine sounds players can choose from:
```lua showLineNumbers filename="client_config.lua"
EngineSounds = {
    -- Engine Sound Name/Label --> Hash of engine audio (what you'd normally put in vehicles.meta)
    ["Baller"] = "baller",
    ["Adder"] = "adder",
    ["Lazer"] = "lazer",
}
```

The left hand side is the label (display name) - this is what users see.
<br/>The right side is our engine sound hash or key.

> [!TIP]
>
> Engine sound hashes on custom vehicles already in your server can be found inside its `vehicles.meta` file under `audioNameHash`

### Example Installation of Custom Engine Sound
Here's an example engine sound mod from [Aquaphobic on GTA5Mods](https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles/toyota-chaser-1jz-gte-i6t-engine-sound-oiv-add-on-fivem-sound)

Once downloaded and installed, you can see in his mod description, he says to add `aqm275amg` to the `vehicles.meta` under `audioNameHash`.

You will now edit the config above to look like this:
```lua showLineNumbers filename="client_config.lua"
EngineSounds = {
    -- Engine Sound Name/Label --> Hash of engine audio (what you'd normally put in vehicles.meta)
    ["Baller"] = "baller",
    ["Adder"] = "adder",
    ["Lazer"] = "lazer",
    ["Toyota Chaser 1JZ-GTE I6T"] = "aqm275amg",
}
```

### Start the Resource
```cfg
start ox_lib
start chroma-enginesoundmenu
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> Make sure that ox_lib is started before our resource.
