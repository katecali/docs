# Installing the Resource
<Steps>
### Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Gravxd/vMenu-ox/releases/latest)
Make sure to download the `vMenu.zip` - this will be the drag & drop ready resource.
 
### Configure to your liking
 
Permissions and other configuration options are available through `config/permissions.cfg`
<br/>vMenu's default configuration guide can be found on [Vespura's website](https://docs.vespura.com/vmenu/configuration/)

### Additional Configuration
As part of our fork, we offer new options to add improvements to your server such as:
- `setr vmenu_using_custom_notify true`
<br/>Easily configure vMenu to use your custom notification script with our handy integrations file.
- `set vmenu_disable_ai false`
<br/>Disable NPC spawning on your server with a simple convar - no need for additional scripts.
These are all included in your `config/permissions.cfg`

We also have client & server config files in the `config` folder with various functions and misc features.

### OPTIONAL: Code Sharing System
We've developed a custom sharing system allowing communities like roleplay servers to conveniently & easily share outfits & vehicles between players with simple share codes.
These codes and their data is stored in your server's database so please ensure you have all [dependencies](/docs/vmenuox/information#dependencies) installed.

Here's a [video preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWYHNAXnCHw) of our vehicle code sharing system in action!
<br/>Or you can watch a [video preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRUil1EUO-Q) of our outfit code sharing system.

You can enable both, one or none, dealer's choice.

<Steps>
### Enable Sharing
You'll need to enable both of the systems in the `config/permissions.cfg`
```cfg
# Enable or disable the outfit sharing system - this requires oxmysql or a sql resource
setr vmenu_outfitcodes false

# Enable or disable the vehicle sharing system - this also requires oxmysql or a sql resource
setr vmenu_vehiclecodes false
```

### Setup Database Tables
You can find the required queries to run in your database in the root directory of the resource inside `database.sql`

</Steps>


### Start the resource
Add `ensure vMenu` to your `server.cfg` and restart the server.
> [!WARNING]
>
> Make sure that `ox_lib` is started before `vMenu` in your `server.cfg`
> ```cfg
> start ox_lib
> start oxmysql # You only need to have this if you are enabling the share code system.
> exec @vMenu/config/permissions.cfg
> start vMenu
> ```
