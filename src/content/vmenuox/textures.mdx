# Changing vMenu Banner / Colours etc
This section is optional and is not required. It is recommended to only do this if you know what you are doing.

> [!NOTE]

> You will need [OpenIV](https://openiv.com/) for this part (editing textures)

In the vMenu resource, inside of the `stream folder` there is a file called `commonmenu.ytd`.
<br/>This is what vMenu uses to get textures for it's banner, selectors and other UI elements.

For the main banner, you need to replace/update the texture for `interaction_bgd` and ensure the updated texture remains `512x128`

For the selector, you need to edit `gradient_nav` which should be `512x64`

Here's an example image where we've edited the slider to be a purple gradient rather than the default white.
