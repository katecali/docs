# Essential Libraries

### Database Integration

- **[OxMySQL](https://overextended.dev/oxmysql)** – A high-performance MySQL wrapper for FiveM, recommended over `mysql-async` and `ghmattimysql`. If your scripts interact with a database, this is the best option.
  - Extremely [fast](https://overextended.dev/oxmysql/benchmark) and efficient
  - Plenty of documentation and examples
  - Used in over [32,000 servers](https://5metrics.dev/resource/oxmysql) (85% of all FiveM servers!), a very popular choice when it comes to database integration.
